    No Comments Necessary 450: Integer Rotation Description
    
    Far Horizons Exploration company has defined the following format for 
    the description of angular heading and velocity in two 16-bit integers.
    
    Angular velocities are to be expressed in angle the rotation
    that would result in one second of motion at the present rate. 
    
    Two bytes are used to express the angle. Their concatenations forms a 
    32-bit signed integer. The LSB of this integer represents 
    1/(2**16) * 90 degrees.   
    	
    Examples:
    	0x0000, 0x0000 represents 0 degrees
    	0x0000, 0x8000 represents 45 degrees
    	0xFFFF, 0x8000 represents -45 degrees
    	0x0002, 0x0000 represents 180 degrees

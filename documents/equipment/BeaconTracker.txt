   Product Code: FHBL-XX-XX
   Product Name: Far Horizons Beacon Locator
   Product Description:
      The FHBL series is a product line of quality transponder detectors. They
      can provide both heading data for all visible beacons, as well as angular
      velocity data for explicitly tracked beacons.
   
   Variants:

      Signal Sensitivity: Code representing the sensitivity of the sensor. This
                      will determine how far away you can detect a weak beacon.
                      Codes can vary from 03 (local scale) to 24 
                      (solar system scale.) Note that the quality of the
                      emitter will also factor into what beacons can be seen. 
                      
      Tracking Capacity: Code representing the quantity of beacons that the
                         sensor is capable of continuously tracking. Users
                         can dynamically ask the tracking co-processor to keep
                         up-to-date information on a limited number of beacon
                         id's, vastly reducing the amount of time taken to
                         perform a detailed query.

   Error Codes:
      0x1 E_NOTFOUND The beacon requested could not be seen
      0x2 E_TOOWEAK  The beacon requested is too weak to get any information 
      0x4 E_NOTSLOT  The tracking slot requested does not exist in this device

   |   |      | In descending order of perceived beacon strength, up to B  |
   |   |      | beacons will have their data stored at memory region       |
   |   |      | pointed to by C. The record format will be the signal      |
   |   |      | strength, beacon ID, heading.                              |
   |   |      | This action will delay the CPU by 50 extra cycles per      |
   |   |      | beacon scanned.                                            |

   |   |      | The scanner will attempt to gain all possible information  |
   |   |      | about the beacon broadcasting with ID B. The information   |
   |   |      | will be stored at the address pointed to by C. The format  |
   |   |      | of the data is: Broadcasting strength octet, perceived     |
   |   |      | strength octet, heading, angular velocity, error codes     |
   |   |      | A tracked beacon will take 4 total cycles to complete,     |
   |   |      | an untracked beacon will take 40.                          |

   |   |      | error codes in A. Note 40 CPU cycles must pass before the  |
   |   |      | speed benefit from having the beacon tracked will be in    |
   |   |      | effect.                                                    |

   All angles and angular velocities will be reported in NCN-450 format.
   
   Broadcast Strength vs Perceived Strength:
      The strength you perceive a beacon as broadcasting as is:
      
      Broadcast Strength + Sensor Sensitivity - Orders of magnitude distance
      
      So long as the perceived strength is 0 or more, you will pick up the 
      beacon on a full scan. If you specifically as for detail of a beacon ID,
      you will be able to at least see that it is present for strength -1, or
      have full information for strength 0 or greater.
      
      Since beacons also broadcast their original strength as data, receivers 
      can estimate the order of magnitude of the distance away without using 
      any additional hardware. If you would like a more accurate distance 
      reading, ask your local Far Horizons representative about our quality 
      range-finding equipment.
   Power Usage:
      A full scan will take 10 units of power per item scanned.

      A detail listing of a beacon will cost 15 power units, unless the
      beacon is actively being tracked.
      
      Beacon trackers will incur a power overhead equal to 50 units per second
      for each beacon they are capable of tracking.
